# Description: 

Hospital readmission is a costly venture for the American Medical System. It takes a toll on the financial stability as well as the operational efficiency of the hospital. Given how many paitents hospitals treat per day on average, necessitating paitents that need further treatment after discharge disrupts the flow of care.
Looking at what we can do to levergae ways to minimize this utilizing Machine learning we have assembled a parntership to tackle the sigsn and indicators that lead to readmission of diabetc paitents adn help to determine the symptoms and factors that need to be treated to avoid further readmissions whether that be within 30 days of discharge or more.

Our results yeilded an overall accuracy of predictions of up to 69%, breaking teh many uncertainties taht come with a long form diagnosis process and greatl;y shortens the discoruse needed to make sure that the paitent is getting the care that they need so taht they may live a good life.
